   KEYBINDINGS
   -----------
   
 WARNING: Keybindings are hardcoded to the US keyboard layout.
          But pattern notes are the same regardless of layout.

 Remember to always use the left shift and alt, as the right ones
 are used for other things.

 == Where's the Amiga key? ==
   PC keyboard:
      Left Amiga key = left Windows key
