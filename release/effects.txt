 Cmd 0. Arpeggio [Range:$0-$F/$0-$F]
 -----------------------------------
 Usage: $0 + 1st halfnote add
           + 2nd halfnote add

 Arpeggio is used to simulate chords. This is done by rapidly changing the
 pitch between 3 (or 2) different notes. It sounds very noisy and grainy on
 most samples, but okay on monotone ones.

 Example: C-300047  C-major chord: (C+E+G  or C+4+7 halfnotes)
          C-300037  C-minor chord: (C+D#+G or C+3+7 halfnotes)



 Cmd 1. Pitch Slide Up [Speed:$00-$FF]
 -------------------------------------
 Usage: $1 + slide speed

 This will simply slide the sample pitch up. You can NOT slide
 higher than B-3! (Period 113)

 Example: C-300103  1 is the command, 3 is the slide speed.

 NOTE: The pitch slide will be called as many times as the speed of the song.
 This means that you'll sometimes have trouble sliding accurately. If you
 change the speed without changing the slide rates, it will sound bad...



 Cmd 2. Pitch Slide Down [Speed:$00-FF]
 --------------------------------------
 Usage: $2 + slide speed

 Just like command 1, except that this one slides the pitch down instead.
 (adds to the period).

 You can NOT slide lower than C-1! (period 856)

 Example: C-300203  2 is the command, 3 is the slide speed.



 Cmd 3. Tone Portamento [Speed:$00-$FF]
 --------------------------------------
 Usage: Dest-note + $3 + slidespeed

 This command will automatically slide from the old note to the new.
 You don't have to worry about which direction to slide, you need only set
 the slide speed. To keep on sliding, just select the command $3 + 00.

 Example: A-200000  First play a note.
          C-300305  C-3 is the note to slide to, 3 the command,
                    and 5 the speed.



 Cmd 4. Vibrato [Rate:$0-$F,Depth:$0-$F]
 ---------------------------------------
 Usage: $4 + vibratorate + vibratodepth
 
 Vibrato will vibrate the sample pitch with a waveform (FM synthesis).

 Example: C-300481  4 is the command, 8 is the speed of the vibrato,
                    and 1 is the depth of the vibrato.

 To keep on vibrating, just select the command $4 + 00. To change the
 vibrato, you can alter the rate, depth or both. Use command E4- to
 change the vibrato waveform.



 Cmd 5. Tone Portamento + Volume Slide [Speed:$0-$F/$0-$F]
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 Usage: $5 + upspeed + downspeed
 
 This command will continue the current tone portamento and slide the volume
 at the same time. Compatible with Noisetracker 2.0.

 Example: C-300503  3 is the speed to turn the volume down.
          C-300540  4 is the speed to slide it up.



 Cmd 6. Vibrato + Volume Slide [Speed:$0-$F/$0-$F]
 -------------------------------------------------
 Usage: $6 + upspeed + downspeed

 This command will continue the current vibrato and slide the volume at the
 same time. Compatible with Noisetracker 2.0.

 Example: C-300605  5 is the speed to turn the volume down.
          C-300640  4 is the speed to slide it up.



 Cmd 7. Tremolo [Rate:$0-$F,Depth:$0-$F]
 ---------------------------------------
 Usage: $7 + tremolorate + tremolodepth

 Tremolo will vibrate the volume with a waveform (AM synthesis).

 Example: C-300794  7 is the command, 9 is the speed of the tremolo,
                    and 4 is the depth of the tremolo.

 To keep on tremolo'ing, just select the command $7 + 00. To change the
 tremolo, you can alter the rate, depth or both. Use command E7- to
 change the tremolo waveform.



 Cmd 9. Set Sample Offset [Offs:$00-$FF]
 ---------------------------------------
 Usage: $9 + sample offset

 This command will play from a chosen position in the sample, and not from
 the beginning. The two numbers equal the two first numbers in the length
 of the sample. Handy for speech samples.
 Due to a bug in the ProTracker replayer, attempting to use this command on
 samples longer than 65534/$FFFF will result in no sound.

 Example: C-300923  Play sample from offset $2300.



 Cmd A. Volume Slide [Speed:$0-$F/$0-$F]
 ---------------------------------------
 Usage: $A + upspeed + downspeed

 Example: C-300A05  5 is the speed to turn the volume down.
          C-300A40  4 is the speed to slide it up.

 NOTE: The slide will be called as many times as the speed of the song.
 The slower the song, the more the volume will be changed on each note.



 Cmd B. Position Jump [Pos:$00-$7F]
 ----------------------------------
 Usage: $B + position to continue at

 Example: C-300B01  B is the command, 1 is the position to
                    restart the song at.

 This command will also perform a pattern break (see 2 pages below).

 You can use this command instead of restart as on Noisetracker, but you 
 must enter the position in hex!



 Cmd C. Set Volume [Volume:$00-$40]
 ----------------------------------
 Usage: $C + new volume

 Well, this old familiar command will set the current volume to your own
 selected. The highest volume is $40. All volumes are represented in hex.
 (programmers do it in hex, you know!)

 Example: C-300C10  C is the command, 10 is the volume (16 decimal).



 Cmd D. Pattern Break [Row:00-63, decimal]
 -----------------------------------------
 Usage: $D + row

 This command just jumps to the next song position, and continues play
 from the row you specify.

 Example: C-300D00  Jump to the next song position and continue play
                    from row 00.
      Or: C-300D32  Jump to the next song position and continue play
                    from row 32 instead.



 Cmd E0. Set LED Filter [Range:$0-$F]
 ------------------------------------
 Usage: $E0 + value (0 = on, anything else = off)

 This command jerks around with the stupid LED filter.
 No one should ever use it.

 Example: C-300E01  turns LED filter off
          C-300E00  turns LED filter on



 Cmd E1. Fine Pitch Slide Up [Range:$0-$F]
 -----------------------------------------
 Usage: $E1 + value

 This command works just like the normal portamento up, except that
 it only slides up once. It does not continue sliding during the length
 of the note.

 Example: C-300E11  Slide up 1 at the beginning of the note.

 (great for creating chorus effects)



 Cmd E2. Fine Pitch Slide Down [Range:$0-$F]
 -------------------------------------------
 Usage: $E2 + value

 This command works just like the normal portamento down, except that
 it only slides down once. It does not continue sliding during the length
 of the note.

 Example: C-300E26  Slide up 6 at the beginning of the note.



 Cmd E3. Glissando Control [Range:$0-$1]
 ---------------------------------------
 Usage: $E3 + glissando control

 Glissando must be used with the tone portamento command. When glissando is
 activated, tone portamento will slide a halfnote at a time, instead of a
 straight slide.

 Example: C-300E31  Turn Glissando on.
          C-300E30  Turn Glissando off.



 Cmd E4. Set Vibrato Waveform [Range:$0-$3]
 ------------------------------------------
 Usage: $E4 + vibrato waveform

 Example: C-300E40  Set sine (default)
               E44  Don't retrig WF
          C-300E41  Set Ramp Down
               E45  Don't retrig WF
          C-300E42  Set Squarewave
               E46  Don't retrig WF



 Cmd E5. Set Finetune [Range:$0-$F]
 ----------------------------------
 Usage: $E5 + finetune value

 Example: C-300E51  Set finetune to 1.

 Use these tables to figure out the finetune value.

 Finetune: +7 +6 +5 +4 +3 +2 +1  0
    Value:  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0

 Finetune: -1 -2 -3 -4 -5 -6 -7 -8
    Value:  F  E  D  C  B  A  9  8



 Cmd E6. Pattern Loop [Loops:$0-$F]
 ----------------------------------
 Usage: $E6 + number of loops

 This command will loop a part of a pattern.

 Example: C-300E60  Set loop start.
          C-300E63  Jump to loop 3 times before playing on.



 Cmd E7. Set Tremolo Waveform [Range:$0-$3]
 ------------------------------------------
 Usage: $E7 + tremolo waveform

 Example: C-300E70  Set sine (default)
               E74  Don't retrig WF
          C-300E71  Set Ramp Down
               E75  Don't retrig WF
          C-300E72  Set Squarewave
               E76  Don't retrig WF



 Cmd E8. Karplus-Strong [No range] (documented by 8bitbubsy)
 -----------------------------------------------------------
 Usage: $E80 (all values behave the same)

 $E8x is a little-known effect, present in ProTracker 1.x, 2.x and 3.x.
 This command only works on looped samples. It will low-pass filter the
 sample's loop section. The longer you run the command, the more filtered it
 gets. This is a sample-trashing effect, just like $EFx.
 
 Note: This command is only implemented in the ProTracker trackers, and not
 in the standalone replayer source codes shipped with the trackers.



 Cmd E9. Note Retrig [Value:$0-$F]
 ---------------------------------
 Usage: $E9 + tick to retrig note at

 This command will retrig the same note before playing the next. Where to
 retrig depends on the speed of the song. If you retrig with 1 in speed 6
 that note will be trigged 6 times in one note slot. Retrig on hi-hats!

 Example: C-300F06  Set speed to 6.
          C-300E93  Retrig at tick 3 out of 6.



 Cmd EA. Fine Volume Slide Up [Range:$0-$F]
 ------------------------------------------
 Usage: $EA + value

 This command works just like the normal volume slide up, except that
 it only slides up once. It does not continue sliding during the length
 of the note.

 Example: C-300EA3  Slide volume up 1 at the beginning of the note.



 Cmd EB. Fine Volume Slide Down [Range:$0-$F]
 --------------------------------------------
 Usage: $EB + value

 This command works just like the normal volume slide down, except that
 it only slides down once. It does not continue sliding during the length
 of the note.

 Example: C-300EB6  Slide volume down 6 at the beginning of the note.



 Cmd EC. Note Cut [Value:$0-$F]
 ------------------------------
 Usage: $EC + tick to cut note at

 This command will cut the note at the selected tick, creating
 extremely short notes.

 Example: C-300F06  Set speed to 6.
          C-300EC3  Cut at tick 3 out of 6.

 Note that the note is not really cut, the volume is just turned down.



 Cmd ED. Note Delay [Value:$0-$F]
 --------------------------------
 Usage: $ED + ticks to delay note

 This command will delay the note to the selected tick.

 Example: C-300F06  Set speed to 6.
          C-300ED3  Play note at tick 3 out of 6.

 You can play the same note on two channels, delay one, and get a
 nice flanger effect.



 Cmd EE. Pattern Delay [Notes:$0-$F]
 -----------------------------------
 Usage: $EE + notes to delay pattern

 This command will delay the pattern the selected numbers of notes.

 Example: C-300EE8  Delay pattern 8 notes before playing on.

 All other effects are still active when the pattern is being delayed.



 Cmd EF. Invert Loop [Speed:$0-$F]
 ---------------------------------
 Usage: $EF + Invertspeed

 This command will need a short loop ($10,20,40,80 etc. bytes) to work.
 It will invert the loop byte by byte.

 Example: C-300EF8 Set invspeed to 8.

 To turn off the inverting, set invspeed to 0, or press ctrl + Z.



 Cmd F. Set Speed [Speed:$00-$FF]
 --------------------------------
 Usage: $F + speed

 This command will set the speed of the song (ticks per row).

Vblank: Range 01-FF - Normal timing  

   CIA: Range 01-1F - Set vblank speeds with CIA timing.
   CIA: Range 20-FF - Set BPM speeds, range 32-255.
  Both: Range 00    - STOP song.
