---- Guide on how to compile the PT2 clone for Windows/macOS/Linux ---

LINUX NOTE: This code is NOT big-endian compatible!

Compiled Windows/macOS binaries are always available at 16-bits.org/pt2.php


== COMPILING ON LINUX (little-endian only!) ==
 1. Install the following packages:
    Ubuntu/Debian and similar: build-essential libsdl2-dev
    Fedora: gcc gcc-c++ alsa-lib-devel SDL2-devel
    Others: www.google.com (you want gcc, g++ (or c++), alsa dev and SDL2 dev)
 2. Compile the PT2 clone:     (folder: "pt2-clone")
    chmod +x make-linux.sh     (only needed once)
    ./make-linux.sh
 3. Move pt2-clone/release/other/protracker.ini to ~/.protracker/


== COMPILING ON WINDOWS 7 SP1 OR NEWER ==
 1. Download Visual Studio Community 2019 (it's free)
 2. Start the installer and select the "Desktop development with C++" package
 3. Install and wait for it to finish...
 4. Open "pt2-clone\vs2019_project\pt2-clone.sln"
 5. If you're missing the Windows 10 SDK, then you need to change the Windows
    SDK version used in the project settings for both debug and release x86/x64.
 6. Compile (make sure it's in Release mode. Also note x86/x64)


== COMPILING ON MAC OS X 10.15 OR NEWER ==
 1. Download and install the "Command Line Tools" XCode package (google it)
 2. Download the SDL 2 framework at https://www.libsdl.org
 3. Inside the package, copy SDL2.framework to /Library/Frameworks/
 4. Compile the PT2 clone:      (folder: "pt2-clone")
    chmod +x make-macos.sh      (only needed once)
   ./make-macos.sh
 5. If you have more than one user in your OS, move
    pt2-clone/release/macos/protracker.ini to ~/.protracker/
